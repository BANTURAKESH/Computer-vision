# computer-vision using opencv 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of functionalities for image and video processing, such as image and video capturing, filtering, feature detection, object recognition, tracking, and more. OpenCV was first developed by Intel Corporation in 1999 and was later released as an open-source project under the BSD license.

OpenCV supports various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB, and can run on different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. It has a large and active community, with many useful resources, tutorials, and sample codes available online.

OpenCV is widely used in different fields, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, security systems, and more. With its powerful and flexible functionalities, OpenCV provides a valuable tool for developing advanced computer vision and machine learning applications.
